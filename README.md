```

Second, set `BLACK_CANDY_MEDIA_PATH` and `BLACK_CANDY_SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable on your sever and point `BLACK_CANDY_MEDIA_PATH` to the readable directory on your server to store your music files.

```shell
# Like this

$ export BLACK_CANDY_SECRET_KEY_BASE="your_secret_key"
```

Then, you should setup database
